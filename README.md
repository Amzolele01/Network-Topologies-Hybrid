## ðŸ–¥ Part I â€“ Network Topologies

### 1. Bus Topology
The Bus topology connects multiple devices using a single central hub, simulating a shared communication medium. All PCs are connected to the hub, and data travels across the same backbone.

#### IPv4 Addressing Table
| Device | Interface | IPv4 Address  | Subnet Mask     | Default Gateway |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| PC0    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.20.2 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.20.1 |
| PC1    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.20.3 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.20.1 |
| PC2    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.20.4 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.20.1 |
| PC3    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.20.5 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.20.1 |

#### Configuration Notes
- Used a hub to represent the shared bus.  
- All PCs configured in the same subnet.  
- Successful ping tests confirmed communication between devices.

### 2. Star Topology
The Star topology connects all devices to a central switch. Each PC has its own dedicated link to the switch, making it reliable and easy to manage.

#### IPv4 Addressing Table
| Device | Interface | IPv4 Address  | Subnet Mask     | Default Gateway |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| PC0    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.10.2 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.10.1 |
| PC1    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.10.3 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.10.1 |
| PC2    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.10.4 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.10.1 |
| PC3    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.10.5 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.10.1 |


#### Screenshot

#### Configuration Notes
- PCs connected to a central switch.  
- Each PC assigned IPv4 addresses in the same subnet.  
- Successful ping tests between PCs confirmed connectivity.

---

### 3. Mesh Topology
The Mesh topology connects every switch to every other switch, and each PC is connected to its dedicated switch. This setup ensures high redundancy and reliability. Even if one link fails, all PCs can still communicate through alternative paths.

#### IPv4 Addressing Table
| Device | Interface | IPv4 Address  | Subnet Mask     | Default Gateway |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| PC0    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.30.2 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.30.1 |
| PC1    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.30.3 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.30.1 |
| PC2    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.30.4 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.30.1 |
| PC3    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.30.5 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.30.1 |

#### Screenshot
![Alt text](./images/mesh.jpeg)

#### Configuration Notes
- Each PC connected to a dedicated switch.  
- All switches connected to every other switch to simulate full mesh connectivity.  
- Assigned IPv4 addresses within the same subnet.  
- Verified connectivity through ping tests between all PCs.

### 4. Ring Topology
The Ring topology connects devices in a closed loop, where each device is connected to exactly two others, forming a circular pathway. Data travels in one or both directions around the ring.

#### IPv4 Addressing Table
| Device | Interface | IPv4 Address  | Subnet Mask     | Default Gateway |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| PC0    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.40.2 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.40.1 |
| PC1    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.40.3 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.40.1 |
| PC2    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.40.4 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.40.1 |
| PC3    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.40.5 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.40.1 |

#### Screenshot
![Alt text](./images/ring.jpeg)

#### Configuration Notes
- Each PC connected to a switch forming a circular ring.  
- Each switch connected to two other switches to complete the loop.  
- IPv4 addresses assigned in the same subnet.  
- Connectivity confirmed with successful ping tests around the ring.

### 5. Extended Star Topology
The Extended Star topology is a hierarchical structure where a central switch connects to multiple peripheral switches, and each peripheral switch connects to several PCs. This design provides scalability and improved management compared to a simple star.

#### IPv4 Addressing Table
All devices are assigned IP addresses from the same subnet (192.168.50.0/24). This allows direct communication between all PCs without requiring a router.

| Device | Interface      | IPv4 Address   | Subnet Mask     | Default Gateway |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| PC0    | FastEthernet0  | 192.168.50.2   | 255.255.255.0   | 192.168.50.1   |
| PC1    | FastEthernet0  | 192.168.50.3   | 255.255.255.0   | 192.168.50.1   |
| PC2    | FastEthernet0  | 192.168.50.4   | 255.255.255.0   | 192.168.50.1   |
| PC3    | FastEthernet0  | 192.168.50.5   | 255.255.255.0   | 192.168.50.1   |

| PC6    | FastEthernet0  | 192.168.50.8   | 255.255.255.0   | 192.168.50.1   |
| PC7    | FastEthernet0  | 192.168.50.9   | 255.255.255.0   | 192.168.50.1   |
| PC8    | FastEthernet0  | 192.168.50.10  | 255.255.255.0   | 192.168.50.1   |
| PC9    | FastEthernet0  | 192.168.50.11  | 255.255.255.0   | 192.168.50.1   |

## Part I â€“ Hybrid Network Topology

### 1. Overview
This section documents the **Hybrid network** integrating all 5 topologies: Star, Bus, Ring, Mesh, and Extended Star.  
The network consists of 22 PCs, one Core Switch (Cisco 2960), one Hub (PT Hub0 for Bus segment), and a server providing DNS, HTTP, and DHCP services.

---

### 2. IP Address Plan
All devices are in a **single subnet** (`192.168.100.0/24`) for simplicity and connectivity.

| Device Type | Devices          | IP Addresses               | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------------------|-------|
| PCs         | PC0 â€“ PC21      | 192.168.100.2 â€“ 192.168.100.23 | Sequential assignment per branch |
| Server      | Server0         | 192.168.100.20             | DNS, HTTP, DHCP |
| Core Switch | Switch0 (2960)  | N/A                        | Connects all branches |
| Hub         | PT Hub0         | N/A                        | Bus segment only |
