## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation and documentation for the CMPG 325 Computer Networks semester-long project.  
The project demonstrates the design, configuration, and simulation of multiple network topologies using Cisco Packet Tracer, with emphasis on IPv4 & IPv6 addressing, VLAN segmentation, server configuration, and network security.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
1. **Part I â€“ Network Topologies Design & Simulation (60%)**  
   - Implement Bus, Mesh, Star, Ring, and Extended Star topologies.  
   - Design a Hybrid topology integrating elements of the above.  
   - Configure IPv4/IPv6 addressing, VLAN segmentation, servers (HTTP/DNS/DHCP), and basic security.  
   - Document the process with IP tables, screenshots, and configuration notes.  

2. **Part II â€“ Network Feature Configuration (20%)**  
   - Configure Port-based VLANs with trunking (802.1Q).  

3. **Part III â€“ Video Demonstration (20%)**  
   - Record a 15â€“30 minute demonstration video explaining the designs, configurations, and testing results.

## ðŸ–¥ Part I â€“ Network Topologies

### 1. Bus Topology
The Bus topology connects multiple devices using a single central hub, simulating a shared communication medium. All PCs are connected to the hub, and data travels across the same backbone.

#### IPv4 Addressing Table
| Device | Interface | IPv4 Address  | Subnet Mask     | Default Gateway |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| PC0    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.20.2 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.20.1 |
| PC1    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.20.3 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.20.1 |
| PC2    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.20.4 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.20.1 |
| PC3    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.20.5 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.20.1 |

#### Configuration Notes
- Used a hub to represent the shared bus.  
- All PCs configured in the same subnet.  
- Successful ping tests confirmed communication between devices.

### 2. Star Topology
The Star topology connects all devices to a central switch. Each PC has its own dedicated link to the switch, making it reliable and easy to manage.

#### IPv4 Addressing Table
| Device | Interface | IPv4 Address  | Subnet Mask     | Default Gateway |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| PC0    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.10.2 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.10.1 |
| PC1    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.10.3 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.10.1 |
| PC2    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.10.4 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.10.1 |
| PC3    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.10.5 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.10.1 |

#### Configuration Notes
- PCs connected to a central switch.  
- Each PC assigned IPv4 addresses in the same subnet.  
- Successful ping tests between PCs confirmed connectivity.

### 3. Mesh Topology
The Mesh topology connects every switch to every other switch, and each PC is connected to its dedicated switch. This setup ensures high redundancy and reliability. Even if one link fails, all PCs can still communicate through alternative paths.

#### IPv4 Addressing Table
| Device | Interface | IPv4 Address  | Subnet Mask     | Default Gateway |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| PC0    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.30.2 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.30.1 |
| PC1    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.30.3 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.30.1 |
| PC2    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.30.4 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.30.1 |
| PC3    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.30.5 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.30.1 |

#### Screenshot
![Alt text](./images/mesh.jpeg)

#### Configuration Notes
- Each PC connected to a dedicated switch.  
- All switches connected to every other switch to simulate full mesh connectivity.  
- Assigned IPv4 addresses within the same subnet.  
- Verified connectivity through ping tests between all PCs.
