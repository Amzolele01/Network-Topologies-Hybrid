## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation and documentation for the CMPG 325 Computer Networks semester-long project.  
The project demonstrates the design, configuration, and simulation of multiple network topologies using Cisco Packet Tracer, with emphasis on IPv4 & IPv6 addressing, VLAN segmentation, server configuration, and network security.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
1. **Part I â€“ Network Topologies Design & Simulation (60%)**  
   - Implement Bus, Mesh, Star, Ring, and Extended Star topologies.  
   - Design a Hybrid topology integrating elements of the above.  
   - Configure IPv4/IPv6 addressing, VLAN segmentation, servers (HTTP/DNS/DHCP), and basic security.  
   - Document the process with IP tables, screenshots, and configuration notes.  

2. **Part II â€“ Network Feature Configuration (20%)**  
   - Configure Port-based VLANs with trunking (802.1Q).  

3. **Part III â€“ Video Demonstration (20%)**  
   - Record a 15â€“30 minute demonstration video explaining the designs, configurations, and testing results.

## ðŸ–¥ Part I â€“ Network Topologies

### 1. Bus Topology
The Bus topology connects multiple devices using a single central hub, simulating a shared communication medium. All PCs are connected to the hub, and data travels across the same backbone.

#### IPv4 Addressing Table
| Device | Interface | IPv4 Address  | Subnet Mask     | Default Gateway |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| PC0    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.20.2 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.20.1 |
| PC1    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.20.3 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.20.1 |
| PC2    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.20.4 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.20.1 |
| PC3    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.20.5 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.20.1 |

#### Configuration Notes
- Used a hub to represent the shared bus.  
- All PCs configured in the same subnet.  
- Successful ping tests confirmed communication between devices.

### 2. Star Topology
The Star topology connects all devices to a central switch. Each PC has its own dedicated link to the switch, making it reliable and easy to manage.

#### IPv4 Addressing Table
| Device | Interface | IPv4 Address  | Subnet Mask     | Default Gateway |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| PC0    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.10.2 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.10.1 |
| PC1    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.10.3 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.10.1 |
| PC2    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.10.4 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.10.1 |
| PC3    | FastEthernet0 | 192.168.10.5 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.10.1 |
